Each experience in this repo follows Beyond Dictionary’s design tenets:

* **Human-first Interaction** — intuitive, emotionally intelligent, and inclusive UI.
* **Typography as Interface** — hierarchy and spacing drive comprehension.
* **Interactivity as Pedagogy** — games, quizzes, and carousels are not gimmicks but meaning amplifiers.
* **Cultural Resonance** — draws from global idioms, Indian philosophy, and everyday metaphors.
* **Playful Structure** — encourages exploration and self-reflection over linear reading.

## 🧭 Structure & Naming

The filenames intentionally reflect **semantic clarity and creative focus**. Each title communicates both *theme* and *method* (e.g., `deepthink_for_seo`, `kids_dictionary_animal_words`).  This allows for easy scaling across subjects and age groups while preserving discoverability.

## 💡 Future Direction

* Integration with BeyondDictionary.com interactive API.
* Expansion into 100+ theme-based educational micro-sites.
* Unified navigation shell for seamless browsing.
